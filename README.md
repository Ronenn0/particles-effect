# Particles Effect – Aim Trainer 🎯✨

This project is an **aim training tool** disguised as a particle animation, built in **2021**, before my military service. It was one of my earliest JavaScript creations, made from scratch using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without any frameworks or canvas.

I designed it as a simple tool to **practice mouse accuracy and reflexes**, inspired by shooting games — a creative mix of animation and gaming logic.

## 🎯 What It Does

- Spawns animated particle targets (`<div>` elements)
- User can click on particles to "shoot" them
- Trains hand-eye coordination and clicking accuracy
- Built with timing logic and movement to simulate aiming exercises

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**  
(No canvas, no libraries — just DOM-based logic)

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
particles-effect/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Creating visual effects using only DOM elements
- Writing JS logic for movement and animation
- Timing particle spawns and intervals
- Click detection, feedback, and interaction
- Building a purpose-driven mini app without external tools

## 🗒️ Background

I made this during my early coding days, **before joining the military**, as part of my self-taught journey. I was fascinated by how game mechanics work and wanted to mix visual logic with something useful — like improving aim in FPS games.

## ✅ Status

✅ Fully working  
❌ Not responsive on mobile  
⚠️ Early-stage code (not optimized or structured for production)
