# Particles Effect ✨

This is a **DOM-based visual particle animation** project built in **2021**, before I joined the military. It was one of my early experiments with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on creating dynamic visuals using only the DOM — no canvas, no libraries.

The project simulates a continuous particle effect by animating many `<div>` elements across the screen using logic and timing.

## ✨ What It Does

- Creates multiple particle elements (`<div>`)
- Animates their movement using JavaScript and CSS
- Runs smoothly in the browser with DOM-only rendering
- Generates a floating, ambient effect to simulate particles

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
particles-effect/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

## 💡 What I Practiced

- Dynamic element creation with JavaScript
- Styling and positioning visual elements
- Using `setInterval()` or `requestAnimationFrame()` for animation
- Applying randomness to movement, speed, and position
- Creative thinking without relying on canvas or external libraries

## 🗒️ Background

This was one of my earliest "just-for-fun" coding projects, made entirely through self-learning. It helped me understand how animation and motion can be built with nothing but basic tools.
